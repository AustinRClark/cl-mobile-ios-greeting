iOS Greeting App

Welcome to iOS land. Enjoy your stay. As the old saying goes, you only get one shot at first impressions. That's why we focus so much on greetings in this class.

In this project you'll find a default single view iOS project. In the storyboard you'll find a button, a text field and a label. Your job is to connect those UI elements to code in `ViewController` and print the user's name when he or she taps the button.
